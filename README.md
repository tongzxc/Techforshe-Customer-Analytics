# Techforshe Learning Pitstop 2020 - Customer Analytics

This dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/santoshd3/bank-customers) contain some customers who are withdrawing their account from the bank due to certain issues. Hence, by analysing this set of data, we hope to be able to achieve certain objectives:

1) Fit the observervations through a model and understand the factors that may influence the customer churn. (via supervised learning)

2) Determine the target audience that are more likely to churn. (via unsupervised learning)

By doing the 2 methods above, we can target a specific group of people to understand their behaviour/reasons for churn instead of targetting the whole cluster, which would save cost in the long run.
